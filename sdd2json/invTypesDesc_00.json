"11":["Life-bearing worlds are often referred to as \"temperate\", as their mild temperatures are one of their defining features. Planets with existing, stable ecosystems are prime targets for colonization efforts as they are generally easier to make fully habitable; as a result, the majority of highly populated worlds are of this type.

"12":["The majority of icy planets went through a period of being barren terrestrials, before being surfaced with ice over the course of many millennia. The exact process for this varies from case to case, but the end result is both common and visually uniform - a bright, reflective planet scored by countless fractures and crevasses. A few icy planets are hypothesized to have been warmer, liquid-bearing planets in the past that have subsequently frozen, as a result of either stellar cooling or failed terraforming projects.",{"graphicID":3834,"iconID":10137,"radius":10000.0,"soundID":20087}],

This expertise was developed not long after other states rediscovered warp technology. It occurred to senior Amarr military leaders that wars of the future would include ship-to-ship actions in space, to include the possibility of an enemy ship boarding another, as they had in millennia past when their ancestors sailed warships on the high seas. To that end, boarding and counterboarding training became a mandatory part of every Amarr marine's advanced infantry training. The development of this capability led to the development of highly-specialized equipment for use in boarding ops, to include manportable high-speed welding gear, outer hatchway breaching explosives, and personal weapons for close quarters combat.

"4005":["With its focus on electronic warfare, few ships can resist the direct onslaught of the Ishukone Watch Scorpion-class battleship's jamming capabilities.\n \n<font color=white><u>Details</u></font>\nThis variant of the Scorpion represents the pinnacle of the Ishukone paramilitary force's electronic warfare capabilities.\n \n<font color=white><u>Development</u></font>\nWhen Ishukone Watch was commissioned to produce a run of Scorpion-class battleships for its parent company, it was decided that a number of extra units would be offered to the capsuleer community to help fund the effort. Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.\n\nThe first of these vessels was awarded to Gallente pilot Jack DuVal on June 4th YC115 as a gesture of good will, after it was stolen from an Ishukone Watch shipyard in orbit of Caldari Prime by the Guristas Pirates, before being abandoned in his hangar in Korama after a lengthy pursuit across the Caldari Border Zone.\n \n<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>\nThough the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special Ladar and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.\n\n<font color=white><u>Notes</u></font>\nMany wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an \"incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.\"",{"factionID":"500001","graphicID":11536,"masteries":{"0":["96","100","165","138","139","85"],"1":["96","100","165","138","139","85"],"2":["96","100","165","138","139","85"],"3":["96","100","165","138","139","85"],"4":["96","100","165","138","139","85","118"]},"radius":250.0,"soundID":20068,"traits":{"3338":{"1":{"bonus":"15","bonusText":"bonus to <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM Target Jammer</a> strength","unitID":"105"},"2":{"bonus":"25","bonusText":"bonus to <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM Target Jammer</a> optimal range and falloff","unitID":"105"},"3":{"bonus":"25","bonusText":"bonus to <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM Burst</a> range","unitID":"105"}}}}],

This brings up the question of how life originally came to planets in Anoikis.\n\nThe molecular clock method was used to estimate how long ago life in Anoikis and life in known space had a common ancestor. In the molecular clock method random changes to segments of junk DNA are examined and compared between organisms. Changes in these segments occur randomly, accumulate over time, and are not selected for by evolution. By seeing how different a given segment of junk DNA is between two organisms, an estimate can be made as to how long ago they had a common ancestor. \n\nFor this case, microorganisms that live in known space and those that live in Anoikis were compared. \n\nIt was found that life in Anoikis split from life in known space during the dark ages, the time period between the closure of the eve gate and the rebirth of civilization. Apparently, during this time, some space-faring civilization survived, or arose much faster than has been assumed. This civilization appears to have moved to Anoikis and made use of the planets.\n\nSome organisms were found that had a common ancestor with life in known space about a year ago. This is likely contamination from recent capsuleer activity in Anoikis.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek'Jaalan Project.</a></i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",{"iconID":33}],

The most interesting one is a certain fungus found on several temperate worlds.\n\nThis fungus appears able to colonize almost any surface or other organism. As it digests another organism, some proteins from that organism are displayed on the surface of the fungal strands. This allows the fungus to evade the immune system of many infected hosts.\n\nSome bacteria were also found that appear to be somewhat infectious. They do not appear to be too virulent, but some of the chemicals they produce are of particular interest. These chemicals have neurological effects that alter the behavior of the host, helping spread the bacteria.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek'Jaalan Project.</a></i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",{"iconID":33}],
"4338":["The Arek'Jaalan Project was founded to act as a cross-organizational research body and common ground for capsuleers to share information about the Sleeper civilization and related matters. The goals of the project are, relative to similar bodies, both simple to understand and quite humble. Put simply, our aim is to research, document and educate.\n\n<b>Research:</b> We aim to posit and debate theories, study known facts and uncover new ones, and use every other method available to deepen our understanding of the Sleepers and related subjects.\n\n<b>Document:</b> Through extensive use of open networks, and with the help of key staff, we aim to document all of the information shared between project members, from everyday communication to large-scale research projects.\n\n<b>Educate:</b> Using our body of contributors and their documented research as a foundation, we aim to educate other capsuleers about our work, and to encourage wider capsuleer interest in scientific matters by presenting information openly and accessibly.\n\nIn its initial phase, the project aims to build a foundational body of documented research, at which point a larger focus will begin to be placed on the goal of education.\n\nIt should be emphasized that Arek'Jaalan does not aim to produce new technologies, and in particular that we take an active stance against any further weaponization of Sleeper or other technologies. We aim for something more benign and progressive.\n\nIt should be similarly noted that much of our work lies in centralizing and documenting scattered, yet publicly available, information. In the absence of these hard facts, we turn to educated theory. Although there is always the risk of information being used for immoral ends, it should be remembered what the majority of our work at the Arek'Jaalan project actually amounts to, and that our own stance is to be firmly against such actions.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the current focus of interest in capsuleer research is applied science, particularly weaponization. The work we do is intended to help humanity, and science as a whole, not just the capsuleer military-industrial cycle. Arek'Jaalan stands apart from the destructive mainstream; as an alternative way for capsuleers to use their unique capabilities. ",{"iconID":33}],

Since then, further studies by Ishukone technicians have revealed several additional ways the microcontroller can be used, such as control mechanisms in robots for industrial usage.

But meanwhile, Korrani has made quite a name for himself within the underworld, choosing to live the life of a rogue freelancer rather than face trial in his nation of birth for murder.
