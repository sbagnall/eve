"27951":["An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a carrier's defenses and logistical abilities. Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the triage module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional power to its defensive and logistical capabilities.\n\nThis results in a great increase in the carrier's ability to provide aid to members of its fleet, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Due to the ionic flux created by the triage module, remote effects like warp scrambling et al. will not affect the ship while in triage mode.\n\nThis also means that friendly remote effects will not work while in triage mode either. The flux only disrupts incoming effects, however, meaning the carrier can still provide aid to its cohorts. Sensor strength and targeting capabilities are also significantly boosted. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship, nor is the carrier able to dock until out of triage mode. Finally, any drones or fighters currently in space will be abandoned when the module is activated.\n\nNote: A triage module requires Strontium Clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one triage module can be run at any given time, so fitting more than one has no practical use. The remote repair module bonuses are only applied to capital sized modules. The amount of shield boosting gained from the Triage Module is subject to a stacking penalty when used with other similar modules that affect the same attribute on the ship.\n\nThis module can only be fit on Carriers.",{"iconID":3300}],

After that, the fused nanomechanical engines are connected to one another, forming a composite whole. \n\nAlthough mechanical engineers have theorized about this construction method for many decades, the process was always held back by a lack of fullerene material. It is said that only hours after the discovery of fullerite clouds in wormhole space, the empires used significant amounts of their fullerene stockpiles to produce these engines.

This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After capturing the data, they then feed it directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously. Functions familiar to any capsuleer such as the overview, tactical overlay and hostile threat indicators are just a few examples of the device's capabilities. \n\nAlthough NVI technology has been around since the inception of the capsule, the addition of salvaged Sleeper drone components and the now widely available fullerene polymers has carried the functionality forward into the new Tech III paradigm.

Mechanical engineers first attempted to create the plating using plutonium metallofullerenes, but it was quickly discovered that even miniscule amounts of them had a sizeable impact on ship mass. When integrated into armor plating in larger amounts, they also risked turning the vessel into a giant warhead, something even less desirable. \n\nA solution was finally found. Tiny amounts of metallofullerenes would be integrated in conjunction with far larger quantities of graphene nanoribbons and then coated in powdered C-540 graphite. This process allowed the material to maintain structural durability whilst keeping mass down. The last and most ingenious addition was to incorporate fulleroferrocene into the metal beneath layers of electromechanical hull sheeting. This had the effect of turning the normally dangerous explosive reactions into kinetic energy, which could then be used to supplement the power supply to local nanoassemblers.",{"iconID":3721}],

"30470":["As a capsuleer, few things are more important in space-flight than the ability to instantly gauge one's surroundings and make decisions accordingly. For this reason, capsules inside starships make frequent use of neurovisual reproductions; emulations that recreate external stimuli using the most low-latency processor available: the human brain. This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After the data is captured, it is then relayed directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously.\n\nThe synthetic translation of external stimuli into neurovisual imagery is incredibly risky, even relative to the standard hazards of pod piloting. Even though capsuleers have an innate resistance to neurobiological damage from these sorts of processes, the near- constant exposure to them has been linked to increased risk of aggressive neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, engineers have begun to integrate neurovisual output analyzers into a starship's electronics systems.

Fulleroferrocene power conduits have become an essential component in the construction of these new vessels for this very reason.

The unique grouping enables some drastic reconfigurations to the basic design. The end result is a vastly increased efficiency in calculation time.

Its official role to quickly appraise incidents of all kinds and relay information back to the Sisters of EVE also serves as an opportunity to take care of any sensitivities before they become apparent to external parties.\n\nIt is particularly adept at venturing into dangerous territories, not merely in recovering whatever may be of interest but also in being able to safely bring it back. Its engines have alternate power sources that come into play should any of its cargo - for which it has plenty of room - cause serious interference with internal systems. Its weaponry runs best on renewable sources, an ideal for a ship that doesn't know how long it'll be in deep space. Its carapace is extremely well armored for a ship this agile, and covered in sensors capable of letting its crew track a myriad of different organic signatures. The crew itself is safely protected from any number of transmittable ailments from rescues and other unexpected passengers, thanks to special quarantine bays that are conveniently located near jettisonable openings. \n\nAnd lastly, an ingenious but cryptic transfer in part of the warp core functionality to an outlying cylindrical structure means the Stratios Emergency Responder is able to run certain higher-level cloaking functions with very little technical cost, and minimal interference from warp.

"34017":["The F-512.185 model 'Vise' Cybernetic Arm is the latest in naturalistic technologies that aim to enhance the human experience rather than cause - or worsen - a disconnect from reality. As such, its components have been carefully designed to ensure that they operate at a level of efficiency that is pleasing and empowering to the human mind, while not going too far beyond that level.\n\nFor instance, there are no unwieldy mechanical joints visible anywhere on the device.

Despite its excessive weight and extended recharge time, the Forge Gun as it has become known, is regarded as the most devastating infantry weapon on the battlefield, and an invaluable tool for those capable of wielding it.\n\nPowered by a Gemini microcapacitor, the forge gun utilizes a stored electric charge to fire kinetic slugs at speeds in excess of 7,000 m/s, enough to penetrate even augmented armor systems. During the pre-fire charge, the forward armature locks into position, stabilizing the magnetic field and helping to shield the user from backscatter and the excessive heat produced.  Power generation remains the single largest drawback of the current design, the onboard capacitor requiring a significant amount of time to reach full power after each discharge. ",null],

"363309":["Adapted from Deep Core Mining Inc.'s proprietary technology, the DCMA S-1 subverts conventional expectations of what a man-portable anti-material weapons platform is capable of. Despite its excessive weight and extended recharge time, the Forge Gun as it has become known, is regarded as the most devastating infantry weapon on the battlefield, and an invaluable tool for those capable of wielding it.\n\nPowered by a Gemini microcapacitor, the forge gun utilizes a stored electric charge to fire kinetic slugs at speeds in excess of 7,000 m/s, enough to penetrate even augmented armor systems. During the pre-fire charge, the forward armature locks into position, stabilizing the magnetic field and helping to shield the user from backscatter and the excessive heat produced.  Power generation remains the single largest drawback of the current design, the onboard capacitor requiring a significant amount of time to reach full power after each discharge. ",null],

"364559":["The Scrambler is a semi-automatic pistol originally designed and manufactured by Carthum Conglomerate. A small-scale directed energy weapon, it produces a laser-induced plasma channel capable of dealing short-range pin-point damage to a target.\n\nPower consumption is excessive, but is addressed via a rear-loaded fuel cell, allowing cells to be exchanged quickly and easily once exhausted. Moreover, advances in the polymers used in the weapon's construction have greatly reduced heat build-up and improved heat dissipation, resulting in improved reliability over earlier modules.",null],
"364561":["The scrambler rifle is a selective-fire weapon capable of semi-automatic and charged fire. Each shot produces a pulse of sinuous energy capable of penetrating shield and metal. By keeping pressure on the trigger, the operator can control the power of each discharge, scaling it to produce an intense pulse of energy fatal to soft targets.\n\nThe added power output does come with downsides, most notably increased heat build-up; left unmanaged, thermal stresses age the focusing crystal prematurely, resulting in splintering and potentially lethal feedback. Despite this and several other issues  increased heft, poor reliability, and high manufacturing cost  the scrambler rifle is widely available and in service on battlefields clusterwide.",null],
"364563":["The laser rifle is a continuous wave, medium range weapon. Targets are painted with a high intensity beam that deals sustained, focused damage in a concentrated area to maximize damage potential.  At the core of the weapon is the thermal cavity, within which an optic spacer converges and blends three individually pumped beams into a single coherent output. The additional distortion introduced by each beam results in weakened output at close range, but as the weapon warms up to mean operating temperature the wavelength stabilizes and the damage output increases significantly, producing a weapon of unmatched precision and lethality in mid-range combat.\n\nHeat build-up is typically managed by a self-regulating failsafe, a device used to forcibly shut the weapon off at regular intervals, flushing heat from its internal workings and preventing lethal feedback to the user, but most laser rifles in the field have been altered to bypass the built-in safety protocols.",null],

When a soldier approaches, the nanohive receives an automated request from the Cortex Holographic Interface instructing swarms of self-replicating construction nanites to begin producing whatever type of ammunition that soldier requires.\n\nThe device itself is composed of three major parts: a composite carbon polymer shell, heavily shielded to prevent potentially disruptive ambient electronic interference; a low-level replicator assembly housing the initial seed swarm; and a C11 power core capable of producing class-one containment fields, confining the nanite swarm as it replicates to its maximum sustainable mass.

The beam, a bi-channel hollow laser, simultaneously acts as both a containment field and transport medium for the nanite swarm, which works to sift unwanted particles from the structure, undo ionization, and reconstruct the atomic patterns of the material.\n\nThe repair tool has several design innovations, the most surprising probably being the incorporation of Amarr focusing crystal technology. Beyond that, the device also makes use of an advanced K7 nano static co-processor on par with Caldari planet side missile tracking systems and a 55x5 reverse current power cell configuration rarely used beyond self-sustaining Gallente drone units.

"365623":["Conceived by Duvolle Laboratories, a corporation best known for its ceaseless R&D, the G75-VLB solves many of the problems inherent in mass-manufactured plasma weapons. The result is a weapon that offers improved accuracy and greater containment field stability (which equates to faster, longer bursts of fire) than anything in its class. \n\nIt is a magazine-fed, short-to-mid range weapon offering fully automatic fire. Charged plasma munitions are pumped into a cyclotron that converts the plasma into a highly lethal bolt before it is expelled from the chamber. Upon impact with the target, the magnetic field surrounding the bolt collapses, venting superheated plasma onto the contact point.",null],
"365624":["Favoring function over form, the SMG is a lightweight, semi-automatic weapon designed for close-quarters combat. What it lacks in stopping power and accuracy it grossly overcompensates for with quantity. Designed to injure and impede, the hailstorm of bullets the SMG produces is most effective in tight spaces against multiple targets.\n\nThis original design is a paradigm of Minmatar construction. An inelegant, but reliable weapon solution that is simple to produce, easily repaired using almost any available materials, and provides comparable pound-for-pound performance with similar sub-automatic weapons. Although an unabashedly low-tech weapon, it excels at what it was designed for: killing anything right in front of you.",null],
"365625":["Adapted from Deep Core Mining Inc.'s proprietary technology, the DCMA S-1 subverts conventional expectations of what a man-portable anti-material weapons platform is capable of. Despite its excessive weight and extended recharge time, the Forge Gun as it has become known, is regarded as the most devastating infantry weapon on the battlefield, and an invaluable tool for those capable of wielding it.\n\nPowered by a Gemini microcapacitor, the forge gun utilizes a stored electric charge to fire kinetic slugs at speeds in excess of 7,000 m/s, enough to penetrate even augmented armor systems. During the pre-fire charge, the forward armature locks into position, stabilizing the magnetic field and helping to shield the user from backscatter and the excessive heat produced.  Power generation remains the single largest drawback of the current design, the onboard capacitor requiring a significant amount of time to reach full power after each discharge. ",null],
"365626":["Using microscale railgun technology, the sniper rifle effectively weaponizes velocity, putting an inert round downrange in excess of 2,500m/s. The standard round is a 2-inch beehive' flechette, loaded automatically from a center-mount pack. The pack design eliminates user intervention and minimizes reload time while simultaneously allowing for future upgradeability; different ammunition configurations require nothing more than switching out the rifle's pack.",null],
"365627":["A mid-range anti-material weapon, the shoulder-mounted rocket launcher provides infantry squads with the means to effectively engage armored vehicles and installation gun emplacements. With pre-launch lock-on capabilities and intelligent swarm missiles, it is a man-portable system able to deliver devastating payloads against material targets.\n\nKey to its success is the swarm missile technology. Fired in salvos, each warhead is fitted with an onboard guidance controller, which introduces random deviations and unpredictable patterns into the swarm's flight path, allowing some, if not all, missiles in the salvo to defeat basic countermeasure systems.",null],
"365628":["The Scrambler is a semi-automatic pistol originally designed and manufactured by Carthum Conglomerate. A small-scale directed energy weapon, it produces a laser-induced plasma channel capable of dealing short-range pin-point damage to a target.\n\nPower consumption is excessive, but is addressed via a rear-loaded fuel cell, allowing cells to be exchanged quickly and easily once exhausted. Moreover, advances in the polymers used in the weapon's construction have greatly reduced heat build-up and improved heat dissipation, resulting in improved reliability over earlier modules. ",null],
"365629":["Designed for close-range combat, the shotgun is a spread weapon with tremendous stopping power. Unlike traditional cyclotron designs, a walled centrifugal well is used to simultaneously shunt dozens of plasma charges, generating a wide-pattern kill spread' that is lethal over short distances.\n\nThe excessive recoil produced by each discharge is absorbed by the pneumatic armature, allowing the weapon to be fired repeatedly without significant injury to the user. The operator controlled crank-action flushes coolant through the interior well before cycling additional rounds into the chamber.",null],
"365630":["The laser rifle is a continuous wave, medium range weapon. Targets are painted with a high intensity beam that deals sustained, focused damage in a concentrated area to maximize damage potential.  At the core of the weapon is the thermal cavity, within which an optic spacer converges and blends three individually pumped beams into a single coherent output. The additional distortion introduced by each beam results in weakened output at close range, but as the weapon warms up to mean operating temperature the wavelength stabilizes and the damage output increases significantly, producing a weapon of unmatched precision and lethality in mid-range combat.\n\nHeat build-up is typically managed by a self-regulating failsafe, a device used to forcibly shut the weapon off at regular intervals, flushing heat from its internal workings and preventing lethal feedback to the user, but most laser rifles in the field have been altered to bypass the built-in safety protocols.",null],
"365631":["A multi-barrel, rotary drive machine gun, the HMG is a singularly devastating anti-infantry weapon. Eschewing the advantages of a lighter frame in favor of stopping power, the exponentially increased heat and vibration produced by this Boundless Creation developed weapon makes it almost unbearable to fire. Yet despite this fact, its above average hit ratio and extreme rate of fire has earned it the nickname Death's Engine.\n\nUnlike earlier models, the weapon requires no spool up time; rounds are expelled the instant the trigger is pressed. This comes at the cost of initially reduced accuracy as the counter-rotating drives slowly align. Once fully aligned, however, the HMG produces a pinpoint stream of gunfire with unmatched killing potential.",null],
"365632":["The Mass Driver is a semi-automatic, multi-shot grenade launcher useful as both a breaching tool and area denial weapon.

"365633":["The scrambler rifle is a selective-fire weapon capable of semi-automatic and charged fire. Each shot produces a pulse of sinuous energy capable of penetrating shield and metal. By keeping pressure on the trigger, the operator can control the power of each discharge, scaling it to produce an intense pulse of energy fatal to soft targets.\n\nThe added power output does come with downsides, most notably increased heat build-up; left unmanaged, thermal stresses age the focusing crystal prematurely, resulting in splintering and potentially lethal feedback. Despite this and several other issues  increased heft, poor reliability, and high manufacturing cost  the scrambler rifle is widely available and in service on battlefields clusterwide.",null],
"365634":["The flaylock is a snub-nosed pistol designed to fire one-inch direct attack missiles. Typically, the weapon is armed with pack-loaded dumbfire or seeker missiles effective against infantry and armored targets, but is fully compatible with a broad range of missile types, making it one of the most versatile sidearm weapons on the battlefield.\n\nSeeker missiles utilize pre-launch lock-on and rudimentary self-guidance to track designated targets, though finite propellant limits the practical engagement zone to short ranges. Although less effective against shielded targets, the tandem warhead allows penetration of armor layers before detonation, amplifying the effectiveness of the narrow fragment stream and maximizing each projectiles lethality.",null],
"365635":["The plasma cannon is a single-shot, direct-fire weapon developed by Allotek Industries primarily for use in urban operations and confined space combat. The dense plasma discharge it generates is highly unstable, decaying rapidly and venting sufficient heat and energy to severely damage targets caught within its critical emission radius.\n\nDuring the short pre-fire charge, ultracold plasma is prepared and then heated inside a magneto-core trap. Just prior to discharge, a small precursor projectile is fired that produces (and is ultimately consumed by) a short-lived trail that helps guide and contain the volatile discharge as it travels towards its target.",null],
"365636":["A close-quarters melee weapon, the nova knife is as deadly a weapon as anything on the battlefield.

Its output and heat buildup are controlled by a L2 Gatekeeper regulator conduit, which connects directly to the sensor system at the base of the neck. Every joint is reinforced with kinetic sensors and two-way, high torque servos to enhance the soldiers strength, balance, and resistance to impact forces. The suits helmet has more integrated sensor, communication, targeting, and data processing systems than most civilian vehicles. As is common with Caldari designs, armor plating is limited to vital areas, relying instead on high-power shield systems to protect the wearer.\n\nAssault dropsuits are intended for standard combat operations or those in which the objectives are likely to change at a moments notice.

A secondary thermal dispersion membrane channels excess heat away from the point of contact, distributing it over a larger surface area and thereby lessening the potential damage. Superconductive veins of hybrid silver coat the outer layers and connect every piece of the armor to a grounding heat sink, dampening the harmful effects of direct fire electromagnetic weaponry.\n\nHeavy frame dropsuits lack the mobility of lighter suits, but this trade-off results in a defensive system that defies standard infantry conventions.

The result is a weapon that offers improved accuracy and greater containment field stability (which equates to faster, longer bursts of fire) than anything in its class.\n\nIt is a magazine-fed, short-to-mid range weapon offering fully automatic fire. Charged plasma munitions are pumped into a cyclotron that converts the plasma into a highly lethal bolt before it is expelled from the chamber. Upon impact with the target, the magnetic field surrounding the bolt collapses, venting superheated plasma onto the contact point.",null],

Feedback from the pulse is filtered to reduce ambient clutter and pinpoint targets lacking IFF signals.\n\nThough the amount of energy required to produce the blast is much greater than its on-board power source can readily generate, the Active Scanner makes use of redundant J-24 micro-capacitors to circulate and build the charge up to the required output.

The beam, a bi-channel hollow laser, simultaneously acts as both a containment field and transport medium for the nanite swarm, which works to sift unwanted particles from the structure, undo ionization, and reconstruct the atomic patterns of the material.\n\nThe repair tool has several design innovations, the most surprising probably being the incorporation of Amarr focusing crystal technology. Beyond that, the device also makes use of an advanced K7 nano static co-processor on par with Caldari planet side missile tracking systems and a 55x5 reverse current power cell configuration rarely used beyond self-sustaining Gallente drone units.

Like most Caldari designs, utility is paramount and so all integrated tech is optimized for secondary support; resupplying and repairing units from distance, only engaging the enemy when absolutely necessary.\n\nWhen deployed, a soldier equipped with a Logistics suit fills a vital tactical role in small unit operations and full-scale warfare, providing both, medical and mechanical support.",null],
"368001":["The Scout dropsuit is a lightweight suit optimized for enhanced mobility, multi-spectrum stealth, and heightened awareness. Augmented joint servo motors give every movement extra speed and flexibility, while integrated friction and impact dampening materials reduce the overall sound signature. \n\nBuilding on recent advancements in biotic technology, this suit incorporates an array of cardiovascular augmentations that are automatically administered to the user in battle, improving overall stamina and reducing fatigue. \n\nWhen missions call for speed and stealth, situations in which heavily armored suits would be more of a burden than an advantage, a scout dropsuit is the best option. The enhanced mobility it provides makes up for its relatively low protection, and when combined with stealth technology modules, the scout suit is the obvious choice for infiltration, counter-espionage, and assassination.",null],
"368003":["The Commando dropsuit is a variable combat unit capable of reacting to battlefield threats as they emerge. Built using a repurposed heavy frame, the suit is designed for maximum offensive flexibility. The streamlined frame does away with extraneous armor layers, using the augmented power of the exoskeleton to instead shoulder the weight and bulk of two light-class weapons.\n\nInterlaced with subframe wiring, the Amarr variant utilizes asymmetric power distribution to intelligently reroute power to the suits various subsystems as needed. This improved throughput allows light-class laser weaponry to draw from the suits power reserves to enhance the damage dealt.\n\nThe Commando is the ultimate suppression fighter. What the suit sacrifices in tactical versatility, it more than makes up for with flexible weapon loadouts that can counter any of the myriad threats an ever-evolving battlefield may present.",null],
"368014":["The scrambler rifle is a selective-fire weapon capable of semi-automatic and charged fire. Each shot produces a pulse of sinuous energy capable of penetrating shield and metal. By keeping pressure on the trigger, the operator can control the power of each discharge, scaling it to produce an intense pulse of energy fatal to soft targets.\n\nThe added power output does come with downsides, most notably increased heat build-up; left unmanaged, thermal stresses age the focusing crystal prematurely, resulting in splintering and potentially lethal feedback. Despite this and several other issues  increased heft, poor reliability, and high manufacturing cost  the scrambler rifle is widely available and in service on battlefields clusterwide.",null],
"368015":["Part of Kaalakiotas Stahl line of weaponry, the rail rifle is a fast-firing precision weapon designed for field operations where penetrative power and range are paramount. Developed using the corporations proprietary microscale technology, the rail rifle solves oversaturation issues endemic to sustained fire electromagnetic weaponry.  However, its greater range and power are offset by a smaller magazine capacity and lower rate of fire than similarly classified weapons.\n\nThe foregrip design aids stabilization and remains cool to the touch even during prolonged discharge where the barrel can exceed mean operating temperatures. Featuring a reinforced subassembly and compact, heavy-barrel design, the rail rifle is the premier fully automatic microscale weapon available today.",null],
"368016":["Conceived by Duvolle Laboratories, a corporation best known for its ceaseless R&D, the G75-VLB solves many of the problems inherent in mass-manufactured plasma weapons. The result is a weapon that offers improved accuracy and greater containment field stability (which equates to faster, longer bursts of fire) than anything in its class. \n\nIt is a magazine-fed, short-to-mid range weapon offering fully automatic fire. Charged plasma munitions are pumped into a cyclotron that converts the plasma into a highly lethal bolt before it is expelled from the chamber. Upon impact with the target, the magnetic field surrounding the bolt collapses, venting superheated plasma onto the contact point.",null],
"368022":["The Sentinel dropsuit is a second-generation solution designed to withstand concentrated small arms fire and protect the wearer from the concussive, thermal, and impact forces of low-grade explosives. Additionally, its power-assisted exoskeleton facilitates usage of the heaviest caliber personal weapons.\n\nBased upon a deep-core construction exoskeleton, the Minmatar Sentinel is capable of withstanding some of the harshest conditions in the galaxy. Hardened shield systems and armor modifications improve its combat durability, while the various op-assist mechanisms used to augment movement make it second only to the Minmatars own Commando variant in terms of overall speed and mobility.\n\nHeavy dropsuits lack the mobility of lighter suits, but this trade-off results in a defensive system that defies standard infantry conventions. No other classification of personal armor can claim to be able to stand toe-to-toe with enemy vehicles and survive.",null],
"368023":["The Assault dropsuit is a versatile frontline combat suit that combines excellent protection, good mobility, and sufficient hard points for mission-specific customizations.\n\nNative Minmatar tech favors straightforward solutions, a consequence of the fledgling Nations indigent past. Stripped of the haptic bindings and sensor technology of the Logistics suit, the Assault variant is a lightweight, low-power solution that utilizes a combination of shielding and resistive plating to thwart enemy fire. Its slimline hydraulic assisted exoskeleton enhances movement speed and user strength, while hard shell reactive armor protects the wearer from a wide-range of small arms ballistics. A mimetic recycler stores and reroutes excess power as needed.\n\nAssault dropsuits are intended for standard combat operations or those in which the objectives are likely to change at a moments notice. Its ability to carry anything from small arms and explosives to anti-vehicle munitions and deployable support gear makes it the most adaptable direct combat suit on the battlefield.",null],
